some files are shared with me 
some files are in some folder but not shared, i only have view  them 
some files are on different domain 
I am not understanding what is the right way of putting all the data in one folder?? Isn"t it too much 
to ask all the employees to put the data in that folder? I meajnn i dont know to do

so its not like for examples this link is only mapped to 1 .md file.

Another thing is that i am not sure
