Pyxis software falls into three broad categories:\n\nPyxis devices and their parent line card CPUs/memory are abstracted as K8s resources. Pyxis device capabilities and 
provisioning APIs are exposed with industry best practices in mind. Resource abstraction extends to device selection, workloads provisioning, and 
enlistment into load balancers.\n\nPyxis hardware begins with the Pyxis ASIC, our AI inference accelerator. Each ASIC is combined with HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) 
into an MCM (Multi-Chip Module). Multiple MCMs are combined into an AI Inference 
Line Card (ILC), which can plug seamlessly into a partner’s router chassis to make use of its high-speed fabric interconnect. Multiple ILCs plugged into such a chassis 
create a Recogni AI Inference Pod, or Pyxis Pod.\n\n\ufeffPyxis Software pecification\nExecutive Summary\nPyxis is the code name for Recogni’s technology 
which delivers a complete hardware and software stack for multimodal generative AI inference acceleration. The Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines all of its major 
components in detail; we provide a short summary here.\n\nPyxis is the Recogni inference 
architecture.\n\n\nPyxis Device is our first generation ASIC for data-center LLM inference.\n\nTensor: a tensor is an algebraic object that describes a multilinear 
relationship between sets of algebraic objects tied to a linear space. They’re also commonly used in physics. Many tensors can be considered a type of multi-dimensional array.[4]\n\nThe 
Datacenter Software manages the relationship between Pyxis devices, connected in an any-to-any fashion via our fabric interconnect. Currently, our selection criteria for Pyxis devices is 
dictated by having one or more Pyxis devices attached to a worker node (ILC CPU) via PCIe. All remaining Pyxis devices can be any type if they’re local to the same chassis. 
The Fabric Interconnect section of this document covers this concept in greater detail.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), AIMessage(content="Pyxis is a software ecosystem 
developed by Recogni that enables customers to create and maintain inference systems within a data center for various users. The Pyxis software encompasses devices, hardware, and software 
pecifications to support AI inference acceleration tasks. Here are some key points about Pyxis:\n\n1. **Pyxis Devices**: The Pyxis devices and their corresponding line card CPUs/memory are 
abstracted as Kubernetes (K8s) resources. These devices have capabilities and provisioning APIs that adhere to industry best practices. This abstraction extends to device selection, workload 
provisioning, and integration with load balancers.\n\n2. **Pyxis Hardware**: The Pyxis ecosystem includes Pyxis ASICs, which are AI inference accelerators combined with High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) 
into Multi-Chip Modules (MCMs). These MCMs are further assembled into AI Inference Line Cards (ILCs) that can be seamlessly integrated into partner router chassis. Multiple ILCs in a chassis form a 
Recogni AI Inference Pod or Pyxis Pod.\n\n3. **Pyxis Software Specification**: Pyxis is Recogni's technology stack for multimodal generative AI inference acceleration. It consists of a complete hardware 
and software stack. The Product Requirements Document (PRD) provides detailed information on the major components of Pyxis.\n\n4. **Pyxis Device**: The Pyxis Device is Recogni's first-generation ASIC 
esigned for data-center LLM (low-latency mapping) inference tasks.\n\n5. **Tensor**: Within the context of Pyxis, tensors are algebraic objects that describe multilinear relationships between sets of 
algebraic objects in a linear space. They are widely used in physics and can be considered as multi-dimensional arrays.\n\n6. **Datacenter Software**: The software manages the relationship between Pyxis 
devices in a data center, connecting them in an any-to-any fashion via a fabric interconnect. The selection criteria for Pyxis devices involve attaching them to a worker node (ILC CPU) through PCIe, with
additional Pyxis devices within the same chassis. The Fabric Interconnect section provides more details on this concept.\n\nIn summary, Pyxis is a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to support

appropriate for this document. The SW spec, in general, seems to have high-level motivations and not system details.\n\n\nI keep wanting to compare this to the HW FSpec. The difficulty is that 
HW docs usually need a lot of detail before the system is completed, while SW docs are usually sketchy at first, and only get details after the SW is in progress.\n\n[f]I agree with the sentiment
